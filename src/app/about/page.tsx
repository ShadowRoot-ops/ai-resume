              ResumeAI was founded with a singular mission: to democratize
              career opportunities by using artificial intelligence to help job
              seekers present their best professional selves.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2022 by a team of AI researchers and career development
              experts, ResumeAI emerged from a simple observation: the job
              application process was fundamentally broken. Qualified candidates
              were being filtered out by automated systems, while others
              struggled to effectively communicate their value to potential
              employers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built our platform to level the playing field, ensuring that
              every professional has access to the tools needed to craft
              compelling, ATS-optimized resumes that showcase their unique
              qualifications.

              Our Technology
            </h2>
            <p>
              At the core of ResumeAI is our proprietary machine learning
              algorithm that analyzes thousands of successful resumes and job
              descriptions to identify patterns that lead to interview
              invitations. Our system doesn&rsquo;t just fill in templatesâ€”it
              thoughtfully restructures your professional experience to align
              with employer expectations and industry standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike other tools, our AI is trained to maintain your authentic
              voice while optimizing content for both automated screening
              systems and human recruiters. The result is a resume that feels
              genuinely yours, but strategically enhanced.
